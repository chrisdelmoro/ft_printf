 The printf() family of functions produces output according to a format as described below.  The printf() and vprintf() functions write output to stdout, the standard output stream; fprintf() and vfprintf() write output to the given output
     stream; dprintf() and vdprintf() write output to the given file descriptor; sprintf(), snprintf(), vsprintf(), and vsnprintf() write to the character string str; and asprintf() and vasprintf() dynamically allocate a new string with
     malloc(3).

The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
     Each conversion specification is introduced by the % character.  The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier.  After the %, the following appear in sequence:

RETURN VALUES
     These functions return the number of characters printed (not including the trailing `\0' used to end output to strings), except for snprintf() and vsnprintf(), which return the number of characters that would have been printed if the size
     were unlimited (again, not including the final `\0').  These functions return a negative value if an error occurs.
